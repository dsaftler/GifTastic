# GifTastic
Giphy API
This assignment was a lot more difficult than I expected: we had done "pausing gifs" in class, but the code to 'click' the gifs was in an HTML, and the same code - word for word - didn't make the click work in javascript.  I tried adding the click functionality to the gifs as they were created, adding listeners, and calling named functions.  The buttons simply sat there.  No errors to look up.  Google had a lot of wrong suggestion, but it wasn't until class that Brian showed  the correct onclick syntax... 

I enjoyed getting the design working. I've been waiting for the final season for a long time.
It does 'collapse' but just because the images are all in line.

I got the 'additional images' coded.
The images have 'title' and 'ratings' in the text on hover.  I wanted to give them captions, and to add to favorites, but ran out of time.
